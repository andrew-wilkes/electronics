## Add a way to probe voltage and current.

Under the oscilloscope, have buttons for adding voltage or current probes. Select which ones are active. Then click and drag on an output pin to apply the probe and remove it from another place.

Use the _on_Grid_connection_to_empty signal to facilitate this.

Need a symbol to attach to the end of the wire for V or I.

Need a way to delete the probe.
